##  🔍 What Sigred is? 

### 🎁 Sigred as a product

is platform for mainly young people to let them sell anything online Safely, Simply and Fast within the community.

### 🖥️ but Sigred as a bunch of code

is almost fully in-JavaScript-written web app, running on Express (Node.js) server. For this project, Firebase was chosen as an ideal solution for database, storage and authentication, according to the current traffic on Sigred. Front-end is constructed of traditional HTML, JS (jQuery) and CSS on the stylesheets. EJS is what serves every single view on the server, so that the user is presented with already fully equiped page.

## 🎛️ How to use Sigred? 

Make sure you are on [Sigred](https://www.sigred.org) 😆

Now this web app is available for both registered and not-registered visitors. 

### If you are registered Sigredian or not,

entering the landing page you will explore what's for sale around you. Each item is presented with its own video (that plays when clicked on mobile screen or hovered over on computer screen), its name, price and seller name. You can open the item, check it out, contact the seller or just simply buy it. If you are not registered, clicking the 'Buy' button will actually lead you to the sign-up page, to give you the ability to buy. 

You can easily visit all subpages, that are not connected to specific user, just like [About Us](https://www.sigred.org/about), [Contact](https://www.sigred.org/contact), [Help Centre](https://www.sigred.org/help-centre) or some utilities like [Cookies Policy](https://www.sigred.org/cookies-policy), [Privacy Policy](https://www.sigred.org/privacy-policy) or [Terms of Use](https://www.sigred.org/terms-of-use).
 
 ### Only if you have signed up already
 You are able to go and offer your items for sale. When logged in, navigate to [Home](https://www.sigred.org/index) and hit 'New Sell' that will take you to the [New Sell page](https://www.sigred.org/new-sell). No need for worries about the difficulty of uploading your item, as Sigred itself is going to take you through the whole process by smooth moving on from one part to another. Firstly, you are going to upload video file for your item, as the video is going to be the only way your possible buyers are gonna see the item, which is one of the main pillars of Sigred. Then, there are few text inputs plus one, that is pre-filled for you, the one with your geolocation. (In next version of Sigred, you are going to be able to change it according to your current position, stay tuned! ♥️) When all filled in, just hit finish button. That's when the item is sent to the server, where all the security checks take place and in case all is just fine, you are presented with a message. It says you're gonna be written an e-mail once your item is there online for all Sigredians (takes around a minute usually, according to number of currently uploading items of other users). ✨ uala, you're a Sigred seller! ✨
 
 Except for selling your item, you can easily access [your profile](https://www.sigred.org/profile), [your items history](https://www.sigred.org/items) or [your wallet](https://www.sigred.org/wallet) where you will exchange your native currency for Sigrecoins to be able to trade on Sigred.

## 🚀 What drove me? 

The main aspect of Sigred, that caught my attention were the pillers of this ides, which are these: going ahead towards future digital age and being eco at the same time - reusing of one item by more people. Sigred is a unique spiece among C2C marketplaces, as it has it all - it's safe & reliable, it has clean design and it has really useful functions. 

As a coder, I loved the idea of pushing something this large and this precious as Sigred is to my GitHub. I cannot express how much I appreciate this chance. 

Huge thank you to Samuel and Adam from [Sigred](https://www.sigred.org) ❤️

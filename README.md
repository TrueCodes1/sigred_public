For this project, Firebase was chosen as an ideal solution for database, storage and authentication, according to the current traffic on Sigred. Front-end is constructed of traditional HTML, JS (jQuery) and CSS on the stylesheets. EJS is what serves every single view on the server, so that the user is presented with already fully equiped page.
